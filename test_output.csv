Depends what you mean. The MPLA probably did best and Dos Santos (their leader) is still president IIRC.

It was Clinton who discontinued funding to UNITA when they killed one too many US citizens, on an oil installation, belonging to an american company, by rebels, paid for by CIA.

But the country is still a clusterfuck of economic mismanagement, resource dependency type political and economic distortions and a general inability to provide sustained economic growth.

So I think we can safely say that it was the Angolans who lost."

im not even bothering with the others, because they're bullshit.

the CDC themselves got a low ball estimate of 500K uses of self defense with a gun each year as opposed to 8500 murder.

on top of that our gun ownership is increasing as well as shall issue states and murder and crime has been in steady decline for 20 years.

Reagan changed this running up huge deficits during good economic times and significantly increasing the national debt and Bush Snr continued this trend. Clinton, finally sorted out the budget and Bush Jnr inherited a surplus when he took office, only to immediately start running a deficit and building up debt through the entire time he was in office.

Now Republicans want to blame Obama for the US national debt.

“If they think I’m huge now,” remarked Christie, “just wait until they see me in 2016, when I run for president.” He said by the time voters send him to Washington, he will be the “fattest man ever to roam the face of the earth.”

“Taft couldn’t fit in the bathtub,” he said, “and I won’t fit through the doors. They’ll have to hoist me up with a helicopter paid for at government expense and drop me in through the roof, the way they do at the governor’s mansion.”
Christie said he will never apologize for eating the disgusting amounts of food he shovels down his throat each day. “I will fucking eat your dog if you don’t keep it on a leash,” he told one reporter. “And I’m not giving any of it to the homeless. Fuck the homeless; they don’t do anything but sit around all day eating food that would have otherwise gone to me.”

Christie, who is regarded by scholars to be the fattest person to ever hold elected office at the state level, lambasted the notion that presidents should be “lean and healthy,” dismissing the last ten commanders-in-chief as “lightweights — hardly fat enough to leave a butt-print on the back seat of the presidential limousine.”

“Sure, Bill Clinton was a little chubby,” added Christie, “but I can devour three men his size for breakfast and still not shit for a week.”"

Same goes for the markets, the stock and bond markets are only where they are because the federal reserve is just pumping funny money into them. Thats called a bubble. Bubbles pop eventually. 

Clinton rode the dot com bubble and it popped just before he left office, W had to deal with that shit, but he made the mistake of working with liberals and inflating a housing bubble to replace it.

Obama is now inflating a stock/bond bubble. Will it burst with him in office? who knows. But all bubbles burst.

Should they only see prosperity under Democrats, will they favor the Democratic party? Of course they will. However, as with most of these techniques, they work better when their subject is not in the forefront; Were the prosperity under Clinton engineered, it could be said that it wasn't that he was a Democrat, it was because of his Socialist policies, though the layman cares not for terminology, he has no word for Socialism.

He writes:

""Many of Obama’s fellow Democrats have distanced themselves from the reform and from the president. Even former president Bill Clinton has said that Americans should be allowed to keep the health insurance they have. Or consider the reaction to the Iran nuclear deal. Regardless of his political approval ratings, Obama could expect Republican senators such as Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.) to attack the agreement. But if Obama could run again, would he be facing such fervent objections from Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.)? Probably not. Democratic lawmakers would worry about provoking the wrath of a president who could be reelected. Thanks to term limits, though, they’ve got little to fear.""
Zimmerman adds, ""Nor does Obama have to fear the voters, which might be the scariest problem of all. If he chooses, he could simply ignore their will. And if the people wanted him to serve another term, why shouldn’t they be allowed to award him one?""

On this last point, he invokes George Washington, the first president of the United States. Washington, he says, stepped down after his second term, but not because he was required by law to do so. Zimmerman says Washington didn't support enforced term limits, citing one of his letters. ""I can see no propriety in precluding ourselves from the service of any man who, in some great emergency, shall be deemed universally most capable of serving the public,"" Washington wrote. By leaving office, however, he did establish a precedent that would be followed for more than a century.

In his ""Presidential Term Limits in American History: Power, Principles, and Politics,"" Michael Korzi, a professor of political science at Towson University, cites the first president's remark, stating that Washington departed voluntarily after his second term ""more for personal reasons than for reasons of philosophy."""

Absolutely this. There's a reason Democrats LOVE the sheer amount of in-fighting in the GOP right now, which reached critical mass during the shutdown/debt ceiling bullshit.

To put things in perspective, let's wind the clock back twenty-two years. The Democrats were heading off of an ideological cliff after Reagan and Bush 41. I mean, they were going full socialist just out of the sheer from losing. But then, in 1992, Clinton was reelected, and he dragged the Democrats kicking and screaming back to the center, to the point where Newt Gingrich has been called THE reason Clinton got reelected in '96. To this day, Gingrich is still a pariah in the Republican Party if the 2012 GOP primaries were any indication.

Today, the shoe is on the other foot. The establishment Republicans rode the Tea Party wave to power in 2010, but shortly after, realized that they created a monster. They've had to defend shit like birtherism, actual racism (look up what that fucktard Congressman from Alaska said about 'wetbacks' which prompted everyone from Boehner to Priebus to publicly denounce and condemn), and not one, but TWO possible debt defaults.

After 2012, when the Tea Party cost the Republicans Senate seats in a year when more Democrats than Republicans were up for reelection because they ousted veteran incumbents whose seats the Democrats basically considered a lost cause and replaced them nominees who couldn't shut up about rape, even the billionaire leashholders of the Republican Party want the Tea Party defanged. Don't believe me? Google ""Conservative Victory Project."" Spoiler alert, it's a Super PAC aimed specifically at primary challengers for Republican establishment candidates. 

And the worst part? The Republicans HAVE someone like Clinton. His name is Christ Christie, and the conservative base hates him because he DARED to care more about the state he was elected to govern after a natural disaster than about election year politics."

the fuck are you talking about?

the ""free market"" is a myth. what you like is competition. competition is great. but in competition people lose. we need to provide for the losers.

these are basic moral principles that we should be applying in our society. not just sacrificing human lives to the free market gods.

Friedman is great. Hayek and von Mises are complete hacks who you should stop reading. Free markets have severe limitations. The state has a role in providing not just for regulated and stable markets but also maintaining fair competition. 

And of course, in any system or any game, there should be a way to let the winners enjoy their spoils but also to chip some off for the losers.

It's really basic. There's no reason to turn markets and freedom into a religion. ""Free marekts"" is such a successful buzzword especially in America, even after it was so obvious that deregulation led to chaos.

The housing bubble is absolutely NOT a result of ""excessive government intervention"". Try to forget whatever nonsense you have heard on right-wing radio or Fox News, because the FCIC and the Fed have investigated this exhaustively and it was DEREGULATION which led to banks multiplying the money supply uncontrollably to throw into real estate.

Look at the basic timeline since demented Reagan began deregulating the S&Ls and bigger banks, and scumbag Clinton deregulated with the CFM and FMA in 1999. Then top it off with Greenspan keeping rates too low for too long and BOOM you have a ""free market"" housing bubble."

and the FCIC and Fed studies have already debunked the talking point that Fair lending acts like the CRA made any contribution to the crisis. most of the people buying up houses they couldn't afford were wealthy people with good credit who were buying multiple pieces of real estate.

1985- Jonathan Pollard Incident- A Jewish American named Jonathan Pollard was caught stealing American secrets and selling them to Israel. At first, Israel denied any involvement in the incident, but later admitted complicity in in 1998. The wife of Pollard’s handler, Avi Sella, worked for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and Pollard later admitted that a prominent ADL member was deeply involved in the spying. Like AIPAC, the ADL does not register under the Foreign Agent Registration Act as per the law, even though it works closely with the Mossad, and has been caught spying on Americans for Israel. Amazingly, the ADL even had the gumption to shamelessly appeal to President Clinton in 1993 to commute their spy’s sentence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also campaigned for Pollard’s release.

1987- Israel Starts Receiving Regular Payments of More Than $3 Billion Per Year. The real US-Israel aid is estimated to be $15-$20 billion per year when valuable military equipment deemed “scrapped”, loan guarantees, under the table aid, and preferential contracts are factored in.

1990- First Gulf War. Saddam agreed to withdraw from Kuwait if Israel complied with international law and withdrew from Palestine. Instead of encouraging Israel to abide by international law, the US launched an attack on Iraq, even though Iraq did not threaten America’s oil supply nor pose any danger to US interests. Israel did not send any troops or material support for the invasion."

In the same conversation, Steiner said he would support any politician who has been good to Israel over his own brother. He also discussed his efforts to get Jewish, and pro-Israel candidates re-elected, even by paying for a rigged poll. Steiner was attempting to raise money for dozens of pro-Israel candidates through his position at AIPAC, even though the organization claims that it doesn’t engage in such behavior. In the conversation, Steiner asked a potential Jewish donor to get his children to write checks in order to subvert political donation laws.

Steiner also said, “We gave two employees from AIPAC leave of absences to work on the [Clinton] campaign. I mean, we have a dozen people in that campaign, in the headquarters….and they’re all going to get big jobs. We have friends. I also work with a think tank, the Washington Institute. I have Michael Mandelbaum and Martin Indyk being foreign policy advisers. Steve Speigel—we’ve got friends—this is my business.”

“I talked to Bill Clinton [and he made a commitment that] he’s going to be very good to us.” ”One of my officers, Monte Friedkin, is one of the biggest fund-raisers for them [Clintons]. I mean, I have people like that all over the country.”

When asked if he knows who Bill Clinton would put on the Supreme Court if elected, Steiner replied, “We’re talking now. We don’t have no commitments yet. We’re just negotiating. We’re more interested right now, in the Secretary of State and the Secretary of National Security Agency. That’s more important to us.” He also said, “we are negotiating” who will be Secretary of State."

99,1386089398,"The case of labor is crucial, because it is the base of organization of any popular opposition to the rule of capital, and so it has to be dismantled. There's a tax on labor all the time. During the 1920s, the labor movement was virtually smashed by Wilson's Red Scare and other things. In the 1930s, it reconstituted and was the driving force of the New Deal, with the CIO organizing and so on. By the late 1930s, the business classes were organizing to try to react to this. They began, but couldn't do much during the war, because things were on hold, but immediately after the war it picked up with the Taft-Hartley Act and huge propaganda campaigns, which had massive effect. Over the years, the effort to undermine the unions and labor generally succeeded. By now, private-sector unionization is very low, partly because, since Reagan, government has pretty much told employers, ""You know you can violate the laws, and we're not going to do anything about it."" Under Clinton, NAFTA offered a method for employers to illegally undermine labor organizing by threatening to move enterprises to Mexico. A number of illegal operations by employers shot up at that time. What's left are private-sector unions, and they're under bipartisan attack.

They've been protected somewhat because the federal laws did function for the public-sector unions, but now they're under bipartisan attack. When Obama declares a pay freeze for federal workers, that's actually a tax on federal workers. It comes to the same thing, and, of course, this is right at the time we say that we can't raise taxes on the very rich. Take the last tax agreement where the Republicans claimed, ""We already gave up tax increases."" Take a look at what happened. Raising the payroll tax, which is a tax on working people, is much more of a tax increase than raising taxes on the super-rich, but that passed quietly because we don't look at those things."
100,1386094941,"Even before the War on Terror, threats to Americans were a common thing. A great example is during the Clinton Administration, where the fear of crazy people with guns killing everyone. This is why the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban were placed. There was an air of paranoia around it all. People who liked their guns and solitude were crazy people, and they were considered a threat. This leads to the discussion of two events that would go down in history: the Waco Siege and the Ruby Ridge Incident. The Waco Siege was supposed to be a raid on a compound under the purpose of seizing illegally owned rifles. And what did they do? They surrounded the compound with a small army and a tank. They shot in tear gas in an effort to flush them out. But why would they come out? They were surrounded by armed soldiers who were there for no their guns, something they have the right to. They were probably afraid they were all going to be executed by them. I say probably because they killed everyone in the compound. Then they released the pictures of the illegal rifles they had, all of which were perfectly fine and unscathed, which is amazing considering the building caught on fire when the tear gas ignited. And this leads to the subject of the Ruby Ridge incident. The initial cause of the mission by the ATF was because the man had sold a sawed off shotgun to an ATF informant. So for selling a sawed off shotgun, they storm his property, kill his dog, then his son , and then his wife. This atrocity was one of the biggest disasters in law enforcement history. All of this brings me to a single point, and that point is Tim McVeigh. Tim McVeigh was the perpetrator of the Oklahoma City bombing. His listed reasons for doing were the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge, the corruption of the American government in how politicians sold out the people who voted for them for wealth and power. He thought this should be considered treason, and traitors should be treated as such."

Hastings, this report says, was instrumental in destroying the careers of two of Americas top war leaders, Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus, along with earning the ire of former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whose top aide, Philippe Reines, told Hastings this past September (2012) to “F**k off” and “Have a good life” after being questioned about Clintons role in what is referred to as the Benghazi Attack which killed 4 Americans in Libya including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.

Hastings 2010 Rolling Stone article “The Runaway General” is credited with being the impetus behind the downfall of General McChrystal, and his 2012 BuzzFeed News Service article “The Sins Of General David Petraeus” likewise helped in the savaging of General Petraeus whom Hastings said, “seduced America and should never have been trusted by the American people.”"

Guns. It's all about the guns. Even the poorest of people have a shotgun or rifle and love shooting it. Historically democrats have been anti-gun. Especially on a national level.

Y'know, I think you and I are closer than we have appeared. When I originally said capitalism works best when there's a tension between capital and labor, I probably should have said between capitalists and labor and we never would have got into this stupid argument. Sorry I called you a tool.

It was the repeal of Glass-Steagall by Clinton that caused the meltdown in 2008. It was originally passed as part of FDR's New Deal package in response to the other meltdown in 1929. Banksters gonna bank.

I know the days of post-war prosperity aren't ever coming back, and as I've said elsewhere in this thread, we have about 15% of the population that is no longer needed for production. Surely we're better off with some kind of wealth redistribution scheme in conjunction with reined-in capitalism than throwing them all into private prisons.

Look, I'm not generally in favor of strong, centralized government, but the democratic process is the only tool we have to prevent the banks and big corporate interests from completely fucking the rest of us. It's probably too late at this point however. I have a feeling that over the next couple of decades, the pension schemes of the Boomer generation are going to bankrupt the entire system, the rich will abscond to their fortified enclaves, and the rest of us will start over with something new.

Chris Christie runs for President pretty much unopposed except for by the regulars, i.e. Gingrich, Perry, Bachmann. He wins the GOP nomination by a landslide. 

Meanwhile, the Democratic side is a battle between Hillary and (now-registered-as-a-Dem-because-campaign-funds) Bernie Sanders, and it goes all the way to the convention. The delegates inevitably choose the moderate Hillary over the socialist/populist Sanders, but the margin is so slim and Sanders has raised so much capital and campaign momentum that he decides to run as an independent anyway and the final election is a threesome.

Realizing that Christie and Clinton are basically identical, some Republican strongholds (esp. less rich states, ie. Missouri, Arkansas, Carolinas, Indiana) begin to slip and cast their vote for Hillary instead of Christie in supreme fear of the big bad socialist winning. Sanders wins New England, California, Washington state and Illinois hands down, and the election is closer in Maryland and Delaware, where Sanders clinches it. Hillary also picks up Arizona and Texas due to an increased Hispanic vote. 

It comes down to New York, which originally declares for Hillary but with a margin of victory of only 200ish votes, forcing a recount. Nothing Bush v. Gore type happens; Sanders realizes that if he wins New York, then no candidate will have a majority and it will go to the House where the Republican majorities in (almost) every delegation will pick Christie, and none will pick Sanders for fear of being labeled a socialist and not getting reelected. If Hillary wins New York, she has a majority of the electoral college and thus begins Clinton Part II: Electric Boogaloo. Thus, Sanders concedes the election before the recount is finished and Hillary wins New York.

That was the federally subsidized mortages

>then Dubya, removing regulations left and right, lowering taxes. It'll trickle down!
The Bush tax cuts were 80 billion a year
Obama's current plan is to pump 85 billion dollars per month of free money into Wall Street
In fact, during the fiscal cliff, the fed bought an additional 1.2 trillions dollars in mortgage backed securities which went directly to Wall Street
And since the fed can't lend the government money directly, they have to go through commercial banks, meaning that they've siphoned off about 1.4 trillion dollars from the federal reserve in addition to the previous two.

Who's really trickling down here?

Taxes are nothing. The money printing is highway robbery and its the highest its ever been right now than under any president.

And the kicker. Inflation hurts poor people, young people, old people, black people - the people with the least the absolute hardest."

I liked him and I miss him, but I'll admit my surprise that Johnson has been much better for our state and nation than I thought he'd be. He helped kill SOPA, CISPA and Mexican amnesty.

He's also met Bill Clinton and had a quite dominant handshake over him (symbolizing power).

You're doing more damage to Obama by continuing to bring up this subject over and over.

God forbid we question the decision-making capability of First Citizen Obama.

And really...what difference does it make?

I'd like to point out that Hillary Clinton, in the same paragraph, said (and I paraphrase) ""we need to understand what we did to them that made them lash out and attack so that it can never happen again"" and then went on to almost immediately say ""what difference does it make why they were attacked?""

They worship around the world, too.

We had a spirited opposition based on some ideology to Bill Clinton. We also taxed the rich higher and it lead to some good economy and we even paid the deficit down to almost zero. The Right Wing had good people. Also I have big respect for Slick Willie.

Now I am firmly convinced this is good vs. evil we are talking about. The conservatives of today have no principles anymore, or morals. They have no answers.

When you ask them about the welfare of humanity they always have only sarcasm, disgust or ridicule in their voices. Or they point to rich left wingers and try to do some false hypocrisy bullshit.

To be conservative means to only care about money, and every Rep politician only cares about helping the rich make money.

Its like this minimum wage thing, they only have objections because of a) inflation and b) because people making money scares them. Yes it scares them. Would you want competition? Papa John doesn't want any more potential papa johns out there who could make a better pizza. 

God forbid they make enough to save for a business or college they could make a better product. They don't want competition so they keep wages low. 

Also inflation, they have billions in dollars just sitting around. If the dollar inflates they lose ego. Everyone else even the US government would gain from moderate inflation because of debt relief. It only hurts banks and people with large money stores. Again its only about money, welfare of people is spit upon.

For 11. , sure legislation could change the organization of US foreign and domestic intelligence however it wants.

DHS lumped together a mutlitude of intelligence agencies under 1 central authority. DHS has definitely been wasteful with spending, but so has every individual agency that comprises it.

DHS includes: 
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
U.S. Customs and Border Protection
Federal Emergency Management Agency
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
Transportation Security Administration
United States Coast Guard
National Protection and Programs Directorate
United States Secret Service
+ Others.

So although a restructure of some things may be good, a DHS equivalent needs to exist to coordinate all of these different agencies that still share the same abstract goal. 

Also Joe Biden, Hilary Clinton, even Barack Obama all have campaigned using god as an inspiration for answers here and there, or saying "" God Bless America!"".

>The Nazi’s were known for experimentation in the field of genetics as well. The Rockefeller Foundation helped fund German eugenics programs. Various human experiments were done to further this cause- indeed much of what we know about hypothermia to this day is because of German research. Additional human trials researched on twins, nerves, malaria, and exposure to chemical agents, reverse osmosis tests, sterilization, poison tests, and high altitude experiments.

On 12 May United Nations Ambassador and Ashkenazi Jew, Madeleine Albright, when appearing on 60 Minutes, was asked the following by correspondent Lesley Stahl, in reference to the years of United States led economic sanctions against Iraq,

 ""We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that is more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?""

To which Ambassador Albright replied,

 ""I think that is a very hard choice, but the price, we think, the price is worth it.""

Her comments cause no public outcry. In fact, the holocaust of half a million Iraqi children is positively admired by the United States government when you consider less than 8 months later, President Clinton appointed Albright as secretary of state. Whilst appearing before the Senate Committee, who were considering her appointment, Albright is literally chomping at the bit for the blood of more Iraqi children and she states,

 ""We will insist on maintaining tough UN sanctions against Iraq unless and until that regime complies with relevant Security Council resolutions.""

Israeli agents place a tap on Ashkenazi Jew and daughter of a Rabbi, Monica Lewinsky’s, phone at the Watergate and record phone sex sessions between her and President Bill Clinton. The Ken Starr report confirms that Clinton warned Lewinsky their conversations were being taped and ended the affair. Interestingly, at the same time, the FBI’s hunt for, ""Mega,"" is called off.

On 29 October Edmond de Rothschild dies in Geneva. Interestingly on the exact same day Anton Szandor LaVey, the founder of the Church of Satan also dies, who in his book, ""Satan Speaks,"" he states in relation to The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion,

The NSA and CIA control the American government. 
They do this by providing false information to congress (see: Gulf of Tonkin Incident, second Iraq War, Syrian chemical attack), by blackmail (Clinton affair, Watergate Incident) and possibly even brute force (Kennedy assasination, Oswald was a KGB-CIA double agent). The CIA also basically sets American foreign policy by filtering what information is given to the US military. For example, American Military Intelligence (precursor to CIA) had full knowledge that North Korea was set to attack the South, but did not divulge this information so that the attack would be particularly bloody and would lead to full scale American and UN involvement in the Korean peninsula. 
It is essentially the worlds worst kept secret that Bin Laden was operating with the CIA in the 1970s, and that the Bush family and Reagan family both regularly met with the Bin Laden family over the course of several decades.

>>>Grunge music was interesting and popular, but mysteriously faded away. Nobody knows what happened to it.

Remember: there was no Internet and the whole Clear Channel radio station consolidation thing that Clinton signed into law hadn't happened yet. Culture moved a lot slower.

By the time grunge reached the 'normal' kids in the suburbs and midwest, it was pretty much already burning-out. Pearl Jam's Vs. album and Nirvana's In Uterero were mildly disappointing... then Cobain was dead. All of this occurred before pre-grunge music had been fully purged from popular culture. Some hair metal bands were still putting out their last major label albums when grunge was dying. It really was that brief.

It just got co-opted by the quickly-consolodating music industry too fast. There was a brief moment of ""post-grunge"" where the industry tried to keep it going with knock-off bands like Creed and Silverchair, but by that time they were looking for the ""next grunge""... a type of authenticity that also made you want to go out and buy stuff, i guess. The economy was picking-up and the Internet was happening by the later 90's, so we got more poppy and aggressive stuff... pop-punk, rap-rock, and ska, basically."

Let's actually look at the similarities between Modern American Liberalism and Fascism though:

>Corporatism
Mussolini employed this to great extent, and the economic ideas of Bill and Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Al Gore, and Robert Reich are deeply similar to the corporatist ""Third Way"" ideologies that spawned fascist economics in the 1920s and 1930s. Hell The New Deal is enough to place modern liberalism in the family tree of fascism.

>Health Crusades
From the war on smoking, to the obsession with animal rights, to the sanctification of organic foods. No one disputes that these fads are a product of the cultural and political left. Heinrich Himmler was a certified animal rights activist (So was Hitler.) and an aggressive promoter of ""natural healing."" Rudolf Hess championed homeopathy and herbal remedies. Hitler and his advisers dedicated hours of their time to discussions of the need to move the entire nation to vegetarianism as a response to the unhealthiness promoted by capitalism. Dachau hosted the world's largest alternative and organic medicine research lab and produced its own organic honey. Nazi antismoking and public health drives practically foreshadowed today's crusades against junk food, trans fats, and such.

Except that's wrong. The USA is projected to decline from 64% white to 60% white between 2010 and 2020 and then from 60% to 57% and so on.

Beyond that you're fucking stupid because at all times the actual CITIZENRY is 10% whiter than the resident population, even whiter when you account for overseas Americans. So the citizens of America in the world are about 74% white right now.

All the GOP has to do to fix this is deny citizenship to illegals, pass a ""you get permanent residency for being born here to non-citizens but not citizenship"" law (the supreme court is ultra-conservative so they'll rule in favor of this if the GOP passes it) and then pass either Security-Based immigration to make it so that 75-90% of our immigrants come from nations with which we have military alliances with- ANZAC, NATO, Glorious Nippon. The bulk of immigrants would be white and non-Chink East Asian. OR the GOP could pass a citizenship quota, limiting the number of new citizens taking the oath to 500k or less each year.

All of this would ensure an America which is 2/3 white in terms of citizens in 2050.

>the senate decides

not really

The house (republican controlled atm) has to bring up impeachment which typically is only when the president has broken the law in some way.

Clinton was impeached by the House when he lied under oath, not because he fucked a bitch in the white house. If impeachment goes through, it just means the president (or any other office they aim at) has been found guilty by the House of committing a crime

The senate (democrat controlled) then has to decide if they wish to remove the president (or other high office holder) based on the grounds that they were found guilty of committing a crime

Right now, if the house were to impeach obama, it would do nothing because the senate would not kick him out of office for it.

Anyone talking impeachment right now is only going to stir up the democrat voter base for 2014

The BEST BET we have at impeachment, is focusing on obamacare to win 2014 and retake the senate, then pushing through impeachment quickly and convicting him through the senate to remove him from office

The real problem, is that even if he is removed from office, the vice president becomes president. This means President Biden becomes a real thing.

Now, the only solution there, is to impeach Biden to, but I doubt he'd do anything to warrant that while hes in office. But if he were, then Boehner or whoever is the speaker of the house would take over as president at that point. for the remainder of that term.

The US is famous for lying in negotiations and blaming everyone else for its actions. If the US bombs you, it is your own fault, you ""brought it on yourselves."" Or, on a rate occasion, it was ""accidental"" like the shoot down of a civilian Iranian airliner, or the droning of a wedding party yesterday in Yemen. When civilians are killed (collateral damage), well, they should have overthrown their evil government. When the CIA encourages people to overthrow their governments and they begin to fail, the US pulls all support and pretends they never had anything to do with it. Qadaffi gave up his nuclear program on the promise that he would be left alone. How did that turn out? Do you think the Iranians magically forgot about that? People forget about Clinton's war on Serbia. An agreement was made there, too, the Rambouillet Agreement, where beloved US diplomat Richard Holbrook ""negotiated"" what amounted to a surrender of Kosovo by Serbia to Albania. Serbia refused to sign it and was bombed into submission. That's the US negotiating style. Agree or die. Agree and die. Might as well go down fighting, then maybe the US will come in an help rebuild. But don't count on it."

I really think Hillary has next to zero chances as a political candidate. Obama appealed to lower-income immigrants, a vast majority of non-whites helped push him into office. Non-whites, and particularly the poor that Obama appealed to, will tend to be much more sexist than many people seem to believe. 

As a rule, nearly every low-income immigrant will be fairly religious in either Christianity or Islam, both of which will tend to state that a woman's place is behind her husband and certainly not leading a country. Hillary is also far from the traditional woman many of them value, immigrants are some of the least ""feminist-friendly"" demographics in America. 

I really think the GOP would have to fuck up royally to lose to Hillary, especially after Obama's second term as he no longer has to keep his public opinion up to ensure re-election. He's already alienating many of his strong supporters by showing (in the media spotlight now, and not just to those who care to look deeper anymore) that he's basically Bush 2.0: Healthcare Edition. 

I'm not saying the GOP is incapable of fucking up this royally, I mean you only have to look at Sarah Palin and Gingrich to see that sometimes they're just utterly incapable. Romney, too, was perhaps the worst candidate to use to oppose Obamacare because his state healthcare was literally the model Obamacare was built on.

The country is headed left now because the GOP pushed it right in 1978 (when California passed prop 13); and because the GOP has done a fucking fine job fucking up the economy and our government.

Now, the Democrats are not blameless; eventually they too succumbed and passed NAFTA and repealed Glass-Stengall under Clinton (but only because of the ""Contract of America"" and the impeachment of a president for having an extramarital affair) 

The point I'm trying to make -as a conservative- is that the GOP is fucked because it dug itself into an ideological corner. Either they clean up their act or they will be replaced by a party that isn't at war with itself and the lower half of America."

The infiltration and manipulation of activist or ideological groups, to diltute, discredit or destroy their message and potential for impact on society. See COINTELPRO for earlier iterations of the tactic.

Suggested by Cass Sunstein
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Sunstein

Sunstein co-authored Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago. Nudge discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that

 People often make poor choices – and look back at them with bafflement! We do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.[citation needed]

The ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and the British Conservative Party in general.[11][12][13] The ""Nudge"" idea has been criticised. Dr Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation The King's Fund, has said:

 We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behaviour changes.[14]

Sunstein is a contributing editor to The New Republic and The American Prospect and is a frequent witness before congressional committees. He played an active role in opposing the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998."

>Steven Skiena, a professor of computer science at Stony Brook University, and Charles Ward, an engineer at Google, analyzed data from Wikipedia to answer that question.

>Skiena and Ward mount the argument that historical figures are like memes — ideas about formerly real people that propagate or fade through history. In this view, Wikipedia represents an acute listening device — a kind of unsupervised ongoing poll of who matters. Centuries on, the meme of Martin Luther is still strong, but the meme of his influential contemporary Huldrych Zwingli has grown so weak we barely hear it.

>Skiena and Ward rank their historical figures based on two factors. One, which they called celebrity, they assessed by the length of a person’s Wikipedia entry, how often it’s viewed, and how often it’s edited. The other, gravitas, weighed the impact of a person’s achievements by looking at where a person’s Wikipedia page sits within a network of linked pages. So, Barack Obama (number 111) gets a gravitas boost because Bill Clinton’s (number 115), George W. Bush’s (number 36), and Osama bin Laden’s (number 765) Wikipedia pages all link to his.

It has nothing to do with that. Bush spent a lot of money. Regardless of who the next president was, we would be feeling the effects from it. But that is because Bush Sr. fixed things up to a point where Clinton had shit easy.

After Bush left office I think economist predicted it would take 10 years before the economy straightened out. This is how it works.

Now because a lot of people held mortgage backed securities (due to the fact that it was considered one of the most stable) the market came to a complete and total halt because mortgages were not being paid simply because the people who held them lacked the means to pay for them as a result of government intervention during the Clinton administration."

Nope. Nobody credible actually thinks that Reagan didn't deregulate. Nobody credible thinks that Clinton didn't deregulate. These are facts. They're not up for discussion.

those aren't citations. you can't argue against the weighting of a deregulatory policy like Clinton's repeal of Glass-Steagall, or the CFMA, or DIDMCA under Reagan or i could go on and on and on.

533,1387394010,"""This is not a case involving 'a quintessential and nondelegable Presidential power' — such as appointment and removal of Executive Branch officials...where separation of powers concerns are at their highest. Instead, the development and enactment of foreign development policy can be and is “exercised or performed without the President’s direct involvement,"" Huvelle wrote in her opinion (posted here.)

Huvelle noted that she ordered the document delivered to her under seal last month and said she disagreed with the government's contention that the order is ""'revelatory of the President's deliberations' such that its public disclosure would undermine future decision-making."" She also found that ""'the President's ability to communicate his [final] decisions privately' ... is not implicated, since the [order] was distributed far beyond the President’s close advisers and its substance was widely discussed by the President in the media.""

(Also on POLITICO: Klayman crows on NSA win)

""Here there is no evidence that the [directive] was intended to be, or has been treated as, a confidential presidential communication,"" wrote Huvelle, a Clinton appointee.

The Obama Administration argued that the distribution of the document was restricted to those with a ""need to know,"" but the judge dismissed that contention as ""amorphous.""

""The government has not, even after plaintiff raised the issue...defined what 'need to know' means,"" Huvelle wrote.
The judge also suggested the administration had lost sight of the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act and transparency itself.

""The government appears to adopt the cavalier attitude that the President should be permitted to convey orders throughout the Executive Branch without public oversight ... to engage in what is in effect governance by 'secret law,'"" Huvelle said.

The White House referred a request for comment on the ruling to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a query about the case."

564,1387620577,"Stanley Martin Lieber was born in New York City on December 28, 1922, in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents, Celia (née Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue in Manhattan. His father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the Great Depression, and the family moved further uptown to Fort Washington Avenue, in Washington Heights, Manhattan. When Lee was nearly 9, his only sibling, brother Larry Lieber, was born. He said in 2006 that as a child he was influenced by books and movies, particularly those with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles.By the time Lee was in his teens, the family was living in a one-bedroom apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The Bronx. Lee described it as ""a third-floor apartment facing out back"", with him and his brother sharing a bedroom and his parents using a foldout couch.
 
Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx.In his youth, Lee enjoyed writing, and entertained dreams of one day writing The Great American Novel. He has said that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center; delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center; working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway;[ and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper. He graduated high school early, at age 16 in 1939, and joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project."

I can verify this. As a past Brooklyner rent was cheaper than Manhattan and it wasnt that bad in terms of crime. Now the jews make up for most of the landlord population in Brooklyn since they saw the wild successful gentrification of Williamsburg they now see they can raise rent cause they know the white upper class will live there. Now that idea is now spreading throughout Brooklyn. You just wait I know that Bushwick and Clinton Hill and all other neighborhoods near Williamsburg will follow the same path. I know this from personal experience. I had an apt in Clinton Hill, which is directly south of Williamsburg, the landlord was the shiestiest of the jews. He tried to scam me and my dad, who was co-signing, into taking all responsibility of the whole apt. It was a 5 room place and I just wanted 1 god damn room. Now once i moved in the place was being renovated but they hired the cheapest Jamaican contractors. They took way longer to finish that I was originally told, they were always fucking things up like water and water pressure, heating, power ect. and durring all this construction and bullshit i was paying $875 a month plus utilities to occupy a 9x13ft room in a 5 bedroom apt. they never once apologized for the inconvenience and straight up lies that they told us about the place.

Not really. Politicians lives are just as interesting, if not more, after they finish their terms in office.

Bill Clinton is my favorite example of this. After he finished being president he went ahead and founded the Clinton Foundation, which is generally used to a) help people around the world in various ways and b) an unofficial vehicle/tool for the future political ambitions of other Clintons, namely Hillary. Just read a list of who attends the Foundation's fundraisers and of top foundation executives who used to be part of the Clinton Administration. You'll see what I mean.

I any case, of particular interest is the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). It was formed in 2005 as a place to ""discuss solutions to the major problems of the world"" by inviting top government leaders and business executives to talk things out. It has arguably been a better model of global governance (you can interpret that terms as you wish) than the United Nations. For example: In the 2006 UN General Assembly, Hugo Chavez was calling Bush ""el diablo"" and Ahmadinejad was purporting that the Holocaust was a myth. Meanwhile, down the street, CGI was enlisting government-level commitments from private individuals to provide safety nets to third world countries. 


This is a unique example rather than the norm, but it illustrates the point I wish to make: keep an eye on what people do after their term in office."

All that aside Gillard's name is poisonous in Australia. Her own party disowned her, she was widely hated from day one has no allies. Overseas though especially in the states she is popular for being a woman leader. That's enough for her to ride on for a long time, in fact people overseas think she was dropped because of ""misogyny"" which was a rare term to hear until she came along. Like you say I wouldn't be surprised if she maintains an active political life outside of Parliament Hill."

Clinton is a committed globalist. It was way cheaper to produce stuff in China back then (thought wages have increased in the past few years). 2+2=4.

Besides, I seriously doubt he was thinking about Hillary's presidential run when he was still in the Oval Office himself. 

>>24540505
It goes back to the point I made yesterday: oligarchy is basic power structure of every country in the world. Americans like to believe that we're all equal, but they are plenty of families that have business and political legacies to this day. The Kennedys are sometimes called ""America's Royal Family"". The Rockefellers still have interests here and there. So on and so forth.

It reminds me of that one article by Rolling Stones writer Matt Taibbi, where he wrote: ""That makes them [Bank of America] not bankers or capitalists, but a class of person that was never supposed to exist in America: royalty"".

I still chuckle when I read that. It was a decent article though. Good reading if you want to learn about the bank's history. Just take it with a grain of salt, of course."

Hilliary Clinton and several other politicians have lauded Saul Alinsky in their speeches. Hilliary wrote her college Thesis on Alinsky's work. He wrote the book titled ""Rules For Radicals"".

This charade of DISTRACTION with Duck Dynasty is no different then the rest of the made for TV distractions like George Zimmerman, Paula Dean, Casey Anthony, Jon Benoit Ramsey, OJ Simpson, etc, etc, etc...

#13) “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.”

By the way, it is worth mentioning that Saul Alinsky dedicated the book to someone special and it is listed in the Dedication...

Opening page - Dedication

“Lest we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology, and history... the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom — Lucifer.”"

Gun control is an illusion, it's merely gun centralization. You're not going to stop the government from handling guns so in effect you are ensuring they are the only ones who ""deserve"" them. The moment you implicitly trust the Federal government on your personal safety you are immediately doing yourself a disservice

Everyone wants immigration laws to be changed.

There he quotes president Clinton's reaction to Bibi's retreat from a commitment.

""At times he was tough,"" writes Ross, ""yelling at Bibi when he retracted an earlier pledge on Palestinian prisoners. 'This is just chicken shit. I'm not going to put up with this kind of bullshit.'""

Aaron David Miller, who was Ross' deputy, also documented the days of Bibi and Bill. In his book ""The Much Too Promised Land,"" Miller relates that during their first meeting in the summer of 1996, Bibi lectured the president about the Arab-Israeli issue, prompting Clinton to expostulate when it was over, ""Who the fuck does he think he is? Who's the fucking superpower here?""

Most definite of all is Joe Lockhart, who was the White House spokesman at the time. In a recorded interview to Clayton Swisher, author of the book ""The Truth About Camp David,"" he described Netanyahu as ""one of the most obnoxious individuals you're going to come into - just a liar and a cheat. He could open his mouth and you could have no confidence that anything that came out of it was the truth.""

Schindler's List is widely acclaimed as a remarkable achievement by film critics and audiences.[70] Notable Americans such as talk show host Oprah Winfrey and President Bill Clinton urged their countrymen to see it.[71][3] World leaders in many countries saw the film, and some met personally with Spielberg.[3] Stephen Schiff of The New Yorker called it the best historical drama about the Holocaust, a movie that ""will take its place in cultural history and remain there.""[72] Roger Ebert described it as Spielberg's best, ""brilliantly acted, written, directed, and seen.""[73] Terrence Rafferty, also with The New Yorker, admired the film's ""narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness."" He noted the performances of Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley, and Davidtz as warranting special praise,[74] and calls the scene in the shower at Auschwitz ""the most terrifying sequence ever filmed.""[75] James Verniere of the Boston Herald noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a ""major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.""[76] In his review for the New York Review of Books, British critic John Gross said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized ""were altogether misplaced.

I actually consider Bush to be far worse then hitler, economically. Sure, Hitler's spending was fueled by debt and unsustainable....But at least he fucking owned it. Ditto for FDR and Obama. 

Bush did not even put most of the Iraq war on budget, or his medicare D, or his tax cuts that came without corresponding spending cuts. 

Hitler at least had a plan (completely ridiculous, but at least it was fleshed out, and he stood behind it), and was up front about his spending. 

And unlike Bush, when Hitler sank the boat, he went down with it. He didn't go ""wasn't me!"" and prance off into the sunset. Hitler had the decency and courage to fall on his sword. Which is what a commander should do when they fail. 

If there is a Valhalla, Hitler earned his seat. 

FDR stood behind everything that he did and made no bones about it.

Obama's a fucking janitor, he does not even belong in the same sentence as the rest of those men. We don't even know who he is, he's spent his entire time in office putting out fires he did not start while people laugh and toss gasoline. He's a lameduck footnote at best.
 And make no mistake, history WILL be kind to Obama because partisan rhetoric is fluid and will not mean a squirt of piss, so people will look at his admin objectively and do the math and understand that there was nothing he could do in the shadow of Bush's massive spend-a-thon and Bush's catastrophic deregulation of SEC oversight on leveraging (for 5 specific banks, not the average joe of course. Go on and guess which 5 banks). 

What'll be really funny will be history's appraisal of Clinton singlehandedly destroying leftism as a political movement when he fully embraced corporatism.

If what MK Ultra Cathy O'Brien says is true, that both Reagan and Clinton took orders from Bush, then he has had even more power than our earlier assumptions. Although an unreliable source, Ms. O'Brien also stated that Bush had arranged for a Democratic candidate to succeed him into the White House. Lets pretend for a minute in our minds that what O'Brien says is true. This would mean that Bush Sr. had, not only direct involvement, but power over the White House from 1981-2001. And then came W. He was used to demonize the Republicans and strengthen voting for a new Democratic candidate. Obama was perfect. Bush no doubt sacrificed his son so that America could move along on this path.

Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding your thoughts on relations between the United States and Israel. I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this issue.

 Israel and the United States have a special relationship. With our shared history and common values, the American and Israeli people have formed a bond that united us across the many thousands of miles between our countries and calls us to work together toward peace and prosperity for our countries.

 Only Israel can decide what is in her security interest, not the United States and certainly not the United Nations. Friends do not coerce friends to trade land for peace, or give up the vital security interests of their people.

 Whether it is fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon, combating Hamas-linked terrorists in Gaza, or dealing with potential nuclear threats in the Persian Gulf, Israeli military actions are completely up to the leaders and military of Israel, and Israel alone.

 You may have heard that I have proposed ending foreign aid to Israel. That is true, however, it is not complete. I have proposed ending ALL aid to ALL nations - including Israel's enemies - and have not singled out Israel or any other country.

Despite billions of dollars spent in attempts to prop up economically weak countries, U.S. foreign aid has had almost an opposite effect. In the 1990s, a Clinton administration task force found that despite decades of foreign assistance, most of Africa, and parts of Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East are economically worse off today than they were 20 years ago."

Forget whether Hillary Clinton could win the White House in 2016. Women still have yet to run many statehouses, but in 2014 two Texas Democrats are going for a new kind of history: Winning as an all-female ticket for governor and lieutenant governor.

Woven into one of the nation's most intriguing gubernatorial races this year is whether Democrat Wendy Davis, whose 11-hour filibuster over abortion restrictions catapulted the state senator to national fame this summer, can not only overcome long odds in a fiercely Republican state but pull off a political first.

If Davis and fellow state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, who is running for lieutenant governor, prevail in their March primaries as expected, they'll form what political experts say is only the fifth time in at least the past 20 years that a party has nominated women for both governor and lieutenant governor.

None of these pairings has ever won — nor have a woman governor and lieutenant governor ever served concurrently. Arizona in 1998 picked five women to the state's top executive offices, including then-attorney general Janet Napolitano, though the state has no lieutenant governor.

The last all-female governor and lieutenant governor ticket was steamrolled in November by New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie on his easy path to re-election. That pair came away some advice for their Texas cohorts.

""Expect to be marginalized. Just be ready for it,"" said New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono, who lost to Christie by 22 points.

Not all nominees run as ""tickets"" in the traditional sense. Texas is among the states that elect a governor and lieutenant governor separately, meaning that Davis and Van de Putte don't come as a package even though they'll overlap in message.

That message hasn't focused on gender."

>The case was decided during the Clinton administration, but the payouts were during the Bush administration. The Bush administration did not share the views of Pres. Clinton or USDA Sec. Glickman and protected the government’s financial interests above recovery by farmers and worked aggressively against awarding Track A claims. Under Bush, 69% of the 22,721 eligible claims were denied. Additionally, 73,800 farmers filed claims past the deadline and were denied review. A contributing factor to the late claims were that were not enough attorneys ready to take the thousands of Track B claims, leading to errors, missed deadlines, incorrect filings, and other problems. The news media criticized the lawyers representing the black farmers, that they did not provide full, fair, and adequate representation. Animosity towards black farmers increased. Ultimately, Congress made $1.25 billion available to settle Pigford II claims, which were the late settlements. These settlements were allowed because notice to eligible claimants was “ineffective or defective,” and class counsel mismanaged the settlement.[15]

Republicans used to be Yankees/West Coast, progressives. 

Democrats were from the South and Plains. They weren't progressive. 

Carter was the first modern Democrat and probably the best of them. A genuine bleeding heart. A maned that cared about his country and people above all else.

Haven't read the thread, but its /pol/ so I'm sure the conservative apologetic arguments have been pouring out. 

The problem with the GOP strategy as of late is that their candidates have to go far-right to get through the primary and then they try to swing them back to the center for the general elections.

All it takes, in the current political environment, for a Democrat to unseat or win a race in a purple district is simply remind the voters what batshit crazy things the Republican said during the primary. 

I predicted this, and I told you all this during the rise of the Tea Party. But no. You were all frothing at the mouth and talking about taking back America. 

The Tea Party has effectively killed the GOP for good. Remember the early 80's up until Clinton?
Strong GOP leadership and turnout? Its the Democrats turn to do that. 

The GOP is going to be wandering in the wilderness for some time now. The sad part is, the full schism hasn't even happened yet. 

Karl Rove's Conservative Victory project is going to get BTFO by the Brothers Koch. We're only going to see more and more Tea Party candidates. Hell, the Kochs even vowed to unseat Mitch McConnell with a Tea Partier.

 Reviews
From Publishers Weekly
Working with a broadly inclusive pantheon of ""the Left"" that places Ralph Nader and Barbra Streisand on equal footing with Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, Schweizer (The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty) suggests that liberalism's heroes conduct their lives in ways that prove their philosophy to be ""ultimately self-defeating, self-destructive, and unworkable."" While acknowledging that conservatives can be high-profile hypocrites as well, Schweizer employs a double standard, arguing that ""when conservatives betray their publicly stated principles, they harm only themselves and their families,"" but when liberals misbehave, they harm their principles first and foremost. Sometimes his research uncovers significant contradictions, as when Schweizer points out that Noam Chomsky, who tends to demonize the military establishment, wrote his first book, Syntactic Structures, with grants from the U.S. Army, the Air Force and the Office of Naval Research. But many of his charges are egregiously hyperbolic, as when he suggests that Cornel West is a ""segregationist"" because he bought a home in a largely Caucasian suburb. Schweizer clearly knows the limitations of his argument, since he backpedals from many of his most damning statements in his closing remarks. For all its revelations, in the end, this volume reads less like a critique of liberal philosophy than a catalogue of ammunition for ad hominem bloggers.

NAFTA was a Clinton Administration achievement, after all. Why should Archie vote for the Meathead party that shipped his job to Mexico?

Maybe they get it all back in “services” somehow, but the working poor notice how the non-working poor live off the state without doing any work. They take it personally that working harder is penalized while left-wing policies reward being lazy and dependent.

No, according to the Keynesian system you need to contract the economics during times of heavy investment and demand, i.e. 2001-2008 or 1993-2001, yet during this time, Clinton and Bush, arguably under pressure from the voting public or corporate interests, loosened the reigns on the economy and banking sector, as well as lowering the central bank exchange rate and taxes (expansive factors that drive the economy forward), causing the overheated bubbles of 2001 and 2008.

Republicans? Democrats? So old fashioned. There are now two parties running for election in the United States: the “More Wars for the Jews Party” and the “No More Wars for the Jews Party”. Unfortunately, you can guess who is winning, thanks to churches in corn-subsidy-welfare-bum places like Iowa, and letting Christian Zionists count the vote (how fucking dumb is that?). That’s how the primaries are being fought. The main candidates in each party are virtually indistinguishable on all other main issues. Despite universal ass-kissing of Israel, the only Democrat the Jewish Billionaires really trust is, of course, Hillary Clinton. The only Republican they don’t trust is Ron Paul. Although, yet again, no one is allowed to state it in public, the entire primary races all turn on which of the real parties the candidates belong to.

1985- Jonathan Pollard Incident- A Jewish American named Jonathan Pollard was caught stealing American secrets and selling them to Israel. At first, Israel denied any involvement in the incident, but later admitted complicity in in 1998. The wife of Pollard’s handler, Avi Sella, worked for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and Pollard later admitted that a prominent ADL member was deeply involved in the spying. Like AIPAC, the ADL does not register under the Foreign Agent Registration Act as per the law, even though it works closely with the Mossad, and has been caught spying on Americans for Israel. Amazingly, the ADL even had the gumption to shamelessly appeal to President Clinton in 1993 to commute their spy’s sentence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also campaigned for Pollard’s release.

1987- Israel Starts Receiving Regular Payments of More Than $3 Billion Per Year. The real US-Israel aid is estimated to be $15-$20 billion per year when valuable military equipment deemed “scrapped”, loan guarantees, under the table aid, and preferential contracts are factored in.

1990- First Gulf War. Saddam agreed to withdraw from Kuwait if Israel complied with international law and withdrew from Palestine. Instead of encouraging Israel to abide by international law, the US launched an attack on Iraq, even though Iraq did not threaten America’s oil supply nor pose any danger to US interests. Israel did not send any troops or material support for the invasion.

In the same conversation, Steiner said he would support any politician who has been good to Israel over his own brother. He also discussed his efforts to get Jewish, and pro-Israel candidates re-elected, even by paying for a rigged poll. Steiner was attempting to raise money for dozens of pro-Israel candidates through his position at AIPAC, even though the organization claims that it doesn’t engage in such behavior. In the conversation, Steiner asked a potential Jewish donor to get his children to write checks in order to subvert political donation laws.

Steiner also said, “We gave two employees from AIPAC leave of absences to work on the [Clinton] campaign. I mean, we have a dozen people in that campaign, in the headquarters….and they’re all going to get big jobs. We have friends. I also work with a think tank, the Washington Institute. I have Michael Mandelbaum and Martin Indyk being foreign policy advisers. Steve Speigel—we’ve got friends—this is my business.”

That’s more important to us.” He also said, “we are negotiating” who will be Secretary of State."

With the surplus thus created, the priesthood was able to command human labor in huge amounts and to direct this labor from the simple tillage of the peasant peoples to the diversified and specialized activities that constitute civilized living.

Dear Fellow Citizen,

A year ago I had what I thought was the best job in the world. I was a political advisor to a very powerful elected official in a pretty safe district. I not only had an insider's perspective on how legislation was really passed, I was even able to tweak laws to favor our constituents. I didn't think there was anything wrong with what I was doing, after all, we were elected by the people and they wanted us to deliver for them.

One cold, snowy January evening I was working late and ran across a report I probably never should have seen... the Army's 2008 Modernization Strategy report, which predicted near constant conflicts in the future, both overseas and at home. An entire Command (NorthCom) had been created to deal with ‘natural or man-made' emergencies, consisting primarily of battle-hardened soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan who could ""use some of the skills they acquired in the war zone"" to deal with ""civil unrest and crowd control"" here... in the United States!

One of the first things you used to learn in boot camp is the Posse Comitatus Act, which was created 200 years ago to make sure the military was never used against the citizens. But, for all practical purposes, this law has now been completely negated through Executive Orders issued by Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama(1). 

The more of the report I read, the clearer it became that over many years the bureaucrats in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike - were carefully maneuvering for an eventual silent coup... one that would never make headlines but would result in the transfer of power from the American people to a secret group of wealthy bankers who already had everything they wanted... except total power."

The first prong was satisfied through fate; the second prong was prevented from occurring through legal ingenuity.

Glass-Steagal was a fine idea until Clinton sucked Goldman-Sachs dick and repealed it. Also some things like the farm subsidies and SS that worked fine when they were initially passed, then became disasters due to changing national circumstances that nobody foresaw in the 1930s. And leading the country through the war.

1006,1389088764,">The lawsuit sought at least $10,000.00 in damages, but not more than $75,000.00. The reason why the damages were voluntarily capped by the plaintiff is because the cap prevented the defendants from removing the lawsuit from state to federal court through diversity jurisdiction. Diversity jurisdiction occurs when there is complete diversity between the plaintiffs’ and defendants’ state residencies and the lawsuit seeks over $75,000.00 in damages. The first prong was satisfied through fate; the second prong was prevented from occurring through legal ingenuity.
>The reason why state court would arguably be better for the case to be litigated is because state court judges are elected by the public or appointed by the governor and Oklahoma is a conservative state—and would therefore have conservative judges—while federal judges are appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the U.S. Senate—and as a result, the federal court that could have otherwise exercised diversity jurisdiction has judges appointed by Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. In theory, a liberal judge would be more likely to rule in favor of the leftist defendants.

During these developments only licensed builders could build, for safety reasons. This helped create the houseing industry complex. Demand further fueled by the baby boom made homes a sound financial investment. With banks getting in on it with loans and a limited number of build designs and builders price continued to climb with no end in sight. 
The higher prices along with many other things made buying a home much harder. More fire retardant and preservation chemicals were incorporated to make homes safer, including formaldehyde and asbestos. So the government stepped in to help the poor, most notably under Lyndon B.Johnson's war on poverty. It was no long just making bad buildings, it had became a political complex just as many other things have. Future presidents followed pushed by the public demand for housing and a surprisingly large lobby group of lumber, chemical, construction and others. 
The S&L scandal under Reagen helped shed some light on this, or at least the financial part of it, but Clinton's housing plan obviously didn't learn from it. Compounded again and again, Bush was no help either. It led to a huge bubble bust I am sure you all know of.
Most buildings in the USA are junk, because we are trying to fix a poor design to start with rather then starting over or looking back at older ideas to learn from them. Using updated other building types like cob or even more commonly brick have shown to be better in many ways, not to mention the environmental friendliness of them. We are just now getting our buildings to meet some standards that were met back in ancient times but at a much higher cost, it is really sad. But thankfully there is a small but growing movement to bring back very useful building techniques that we have lost. There are many obstacles to this, but hopefully we can stop doing such stupid things."

You asshole neckbeards are as bad as the rapists. Amanda takes the eroticization of her sexual slavery personally

From a Feminist Magazine:

The media diminishes and re-victimizes Lindhout again and again by disclosing unnecessary details she has asked them not to share. There are reasons she has requested discretion.

In her many public talks over the last three years about what she experienced, Lindhout herself never actually used the words “rape” or “torture”—until now. She says she knew that it would spur imaginations in ways she felt were invasive and unnecessary. Exactly how was she tortured? How many times was she raped?

Poorly presented stories have had real, terrible consequences for Lindhout. A February 5 story titled “Woman of Vision” in the Calgary Herald mentioned the tantalizing detail that she was sexually abused “daily”; it spurred two men to send her frightening messages asking if she “enjoyed the daily rapes.” 

I have gotten to know Lindhout over these years and am deeply inspired by her strength and success, which includes talking about her work helping women, such as at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2012. On February 14, she chose to speak out for One Billion Rising, the campaign organized by Eve Ensler’s V-Day that encourages women to “rise up” against violence. She also chose to use the word “rape” publicly for the first time. Her speech was remarkable. Here is an excerpt:"

I will still respect your argument, however based on wild emotions and false facts, and counter it with real fact.

Smart gun advocates are the dumbest people I have ever met. Does it not occur to you that a mere child could disable the most advanced smart gun just with the tools needed to field strip the gun for cleaning? 

Smart-gun tech will stop school shootings in the same way governator chips in cars prevents street racing. It doesn't, at all. It's not that it has only a slight effect. It is that it has no effect.

Not a single smart gun hypothetical would prevent crimes. It's just an elaborate paper trail to go to after said crime has been committed presuming the criminal didn't jail-break his gun.

Gates acknowledges forthrightly in “Duty” that he did not reveal his dismay. “I never confronted Obama directly over what I (as well as [Hillary] Clinton, [then-CIA Director Leon] Panetta, and others) saw as the president’s determination that the White House tightly control every aspect of national security policy and even operations. His White House was by far the most centralized and controlling in national security of any I had seen since Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger ruled the roost.”
It got so bad during internal debates over whether to intervene in Libya in 2011 that Gates says he felt compelled to deliver a “rant” because the White House staff was “talking about military options with the president without Defense being involved.”
Gates says his instructions to the Pentagon were: “Don’t give the White House staff and [national security staff] too much information on the military options. They don’t understand it, and ‘experts’ like Samantha Power will decide when we should move militarily.” Power, then on the national security staff and now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has been a strong advocate for humanitarian intervention.
Another time, after Donilon and Biden tried to pass orders to Gates, he told the two, “The last time I checked, neither of you are in the chain of command,” and said he expected to get orders directly from Obama.

Hillary Clinton is Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of 2013.

Although speculation and rumors have been swirling for months over whether Clinton will make another run for the White House in 2016, she said she hasn't decided yet.

""I haven't made up my mind,"" Clinton told Walters in the ABC News special ""Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2013.""

Walters' choice of Hillary Clinton as the Most Fascinating Person of 2013 for Walters' last installment of ""The 10 Most Fascinating People of the Year"" is a poignant one.

In addition, Clinton could decide to campaign for 2014 Democratic candidates, many of whom are old friends and allies. She helped two candidates get elected this fall — Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. Doing the same in 2014 could help her amass support for a presidential run and help retain a Democratic-controlled Senate for a future President Clinton to work with."

Ryan will headline a Dec. 12 event in Washington, D.C, with an admission cost of $20.16, that the organization will use to build up its list of supporters. Ryan said he'll also speak at an upcoming event in New York City.

The Super PAC claims to have more than one million supporters lined up to back Clinton's presidential campaign, if she decides to run. Ryan -- who also backed Clinton in 2008 -- predicted she would be ""a transformational leader for our country,"" whose campaign would energize women voters."

>Aaron David Miller, who was Ross' deputy, also documented the days of Bibi and Bill. In his book ""The Much Too Promised Land,"" Miller relates that during their first meeting in the summer of 1996, Bibi lectured the president about the Arab-Israeli issue, prompting Clinton to expostulate when it was over, ""Who the fuck does he think he is? Who's the fucking superpower here?""

>Most definite of all is Joe Lockhart, who was the White House spokesman at the time. In a recorded interview to Clayton Swisher, author of the book ""The Truth About Camp David,"" he described Netanyahu as ""one of the most obnoxious individuals you're going to come into - just a liar and a cheat. He could open his mouth and you could have no confidence that anything that came out of it was the truth.""

Not quite, this is actually a political engine known as 'Fast Tracking' that would be used to try and pass the TPP without amendments, forcing Congress to come to either a yay or nay decision within 90 days of it being signed by the President - which he can do in advance.

However, having done some searching on the issue, it seems that a large part of Obama's own party is unwilling to grant him the permission to Fast Track.

And really, Congress should stay opposed since Fast Tracking would weaken their power and TPP would weaken them even further. To top it off it's an election year for them.

Yes, every legal expert agrees all that is required is citizenship by birth. John McCain and Ted Cruz both born overseas

The Constitution says any candidate for president must be 35 years of age, a resident within the United States for 14 years and a ""natural born citizen.""

Back in 2008, people raised questions about the ""natural born"" citizenship status of both major party candidates.

Cruz -- full name: Rafael Edward Cruz --was born in Canada in 1970 because his father was working for the oil industry there. The senator’s recently released birth certificate shows his mother was born in Delaware and his father was born in Cuba.

John McCain, who was born in the Panama Canal Zone because his American father served in the military. McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, saw his standing briefly challenged in court.

Interestingly, both of McCain’s potential Democratic opponents -- Obama and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton -- co-sponsored a Senate measure to settle McCain’s eligibility. The April 2008 resolution said, ""John Sidney McCain, III, is a 'natural born Citizen' under Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution of the United States.""

The consensus was that someone is a ""natural born"" citizen if they have citizenship at birth and don’t have to go through a naturalization process to become a citizen.

The Congressional Research Service published a report on the issue after the 2008 election; the agency is tasked with providing authoritative research to all members of Congress. It, too, supported the thinking that ""natural born"" citizenship means citizenship held ""at birth.""

But the Supreme Court -- the ultimate arbiter of constitutional questions -- has never ruled on the matter. And that means a note of uncertainty remains.

So even if Obama had been born in Kenya he would still be eligible as Cruz would be despite being born overseas and having a Cuban father."
1184,1389354829,"The economic depression which is incoming has very little to do with Obama, while he hasn't done enough to prevent the impending famines and social rot, these things are just to be expected when you listen to Chicago school lassiez faire, economists, who have been running the world economy since the 1970's. 

If you want to point the finger at any one president, the one who deserves the lions share of the blame is undoubtedly Clinton. He was told in the 90's that free trade was going to kill the US economy and he didn't give a flying fuck. He sold us all out and took the money. He was aided on both sides of the aisle. The few democrats and republicans that fought against free trade were systematically targeted and removed from office. Obama is just another post-Clinton politician."
1185,1389356476,"Clintons policy of deregulating the SEC during his presidency set up the economy for failure in the 2000's. His approval of NAFTA guaranteed the destruction of the US manufacturing base and the transition of our economy from producers and exporters to consumers and importers. Once the money started flowing both parties took advantage and niether stopped it. 

Ask yourself, if you are old enough, who many of the numerous call centers and factories existed around the country are still there? Even Ford Chevy and GM are making their cars outside the US, the parts maybe made stateside, but they are assembled in Mexico or Brazil. Both parties are too blame, but one got the ball rolling, knowing damn well what it would lead too."

Adolf Hitler was ""wholly ignorant"" of economics, Ian Kershaw boldly writes in his excellent new study, Hitler, 1889-1936: Hubris. What the dictator did know was politics and how to achieve public support--Hitler was an immensely popular leader with approval ratings even Bill Clinton would envy--and early on, he made it clear that economics would be subordinate to politics.

One odd result of Hitler's decision is that few of his biographers have paid much attention to his economic policies prior to the Nazis' first overt military act, the reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936. Indeed, if they pay any attention at all to the subject, most merely accept Nazi propaganda claims of Hitler's ""economic miracle"" in restoring Germany's prosperity. Kershaw's book is a welcome exception to this tendency.

The general view that Germany's shattered economy surged to life in the first few years of the Nazi regime is typified by Sebastian Haffner, a German writer whose short book The Meaning of Hitler (1979) received extravagant praise in John Lukacs' recent The Hitler of History. As Haffner put it, ""Among these positive achievements of Hitler the one outshining all others was his economic miracle....In January 1933, when Hitler became Reich Chancellor, there were six million unemployed in Germany. A mere three years later, in 1936, there was full employment. Crying need and mass hardship had generally turned into modest but comfortable prosperity."

The biggest minority in the USA are the hispanics followed by the blacks. Their reproduction rate is many times that of the whites and by 2040 (approximate), the hispanics and blacks will become the majority of the USA population and whites will be the minority. 

The white minority will continue to be the majority source of funding for all social welfare programs. President Clinton reformed welfare to require the person at least work (after 2 years) unless disabled. That is not good enough since approximately 25% of welfare blacks apply for disability of some sort and thus avoid the cutoff.

Six years later, Marx used Roosevelt's principles to write his Communist Manifesto.

But that's wrong.

Clinton ran deficits through all 8 years of his term, and one can go to the US Treasury Department and looking through the history of the total outstanding debt through Clinton's term.

Every year Clinton was in office, the total national debt continued to climb.

How Clinton managed to claim a surplus was that while the general operating budgets ran deficits but Clinton borrowed from numerous off budget funds to make the on budget fund a surplus.

For example, in 2000, Clinton claimed a $230B surplus, but Clinton borrowed
$152.3B from Social Security
$30.9B from Civil Service Retirement Fund
$18.5B from Federal Supplementary Medical insurance Trust Fund
$15.0B from Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund
$9.0B from the Federal Unemployment Trust Fund
$8.2B from Military Retirement Fund
$3.8B from Transportation Trust Funds
$1.8B from Employee Life Insurance & Retirement fund
$7.0B from others

Total borrowed from off budget funds $246.5B, meaning that his $230B surplus is actually a $16.5B deficit.

My theory is that the Democrats really went off the rails after 1980. If you look at people like Obama and Di Blasio they all got started in the 1980s.

People forget how virulent the Reagan hate was back then. You had people like Di Blasio who literally went down to fight alongside the Contras just because they hated Reagan so much for completely destroying Carter in 1980. It was comparable to the way that Repubs reacted to Obama.

Clinton didn't go that far because the GOP was strong enough to keep him in check and there were still enough older Dem voters that would object to the Marxist SJW shit, but now that the GOP is totally disorganized and the older voters are dead there's nothing holding the SJW's in the Democratic party in check."

Oh, I forgot possibly the worst story out of the bunch:

I got some pretty bad food poisoning from a restaurant in Shanghai that supposedly served The Queen and Bill Clinton. We had eaten lunch there the day we were flying to Beijing to catch a flight to Mongolia the next day. As the plane started lifting off I could feel myself losing it and I ended up throwing up twice. I filled up one complete air sickness bag the first time and then half of one the next. By the time we got to Beijing I was exhausted. We were staying at the Beijing Airport Garden Hotel that night as it was the closest to the airport and we had a flight to catch the next day.

I was laying outside the terminal on the sidewalk waiting for them to pick us up for about 45 minutes. When we got there, the staff were incredibly rude. I was trying to get some bottled water at the store and she yelled at me, ""NO YOU GO UPSTAIRS."" I trudge up to the hotel restaurant and there are two guys waiting for their food. They look at me and ask if I'm eating here and I told them that I just needed something to drink. ""Good,"" they said, ""this place is a bit adventurous."" I understood what they meant when their food showed up. It was served in a cafeteria tray and each one was filled with mysterious blobs that looked more like congealed paint than food.

I got my drinks and went up to my room, plopped down on the bed and...it was hard as concrete. I rolled over and there was a blood splatter on the wall. I just said fuck it and went to sleep."

Well thanks for your rational response, it's a refreshing change of pace here. 

It obviously has a detrimental effect on my argument. 

The point being, first and foremost, that this action is treasonous. People have literally died because of this. The Obama administration may have attempted to play off ""fast and furious"" (somehow, I don't really even understand how they dodged that one), but this is legitimate documentation of the cooperation between the DEA and the Sinaloa (who, if they were an army, would have been condemned as committing war crimes years ago). If you walk through a heavily drug infested neighborhood in Chicago, you have this administration and the Bush administration and the Clinton administration to thank (if it doesn't go further back than that).

Really?

You didn't at once think that idealistic lofty notions where you- like the religious right try to legislate morality was going to work?

Listen man, people are fucking hurting. People want jobs, they want careers, they want the ability to move up in the world not mediocrity, suffering, uncertainty, new and unaffordable taxes on their miserable life. 

You nuts always think the answer is some new social program stemming from social justice and doesn't work.

Look at the Affordable Healthcare Law, sounds great- affordable health insurance for all. Again, lofty and seems reasonable to have in the modern age for all people.

But yet it's not- it's a death spiral of uncertainty for people, all people. Not just the evil whites, oppressed blacks, etc. It has 21, twenty one new taxes and fees to everyone, your negro neighbor in the hood a few blocks over or the white trash fucker down the street. 

So you can see how there's now a fucking push back against your agenda when it's hurting people. When this is replicated with hordes of other programs, taxes, and fees for everyone over a period of years it's madness. 

Think about it. There is no recovery from Clinton's housing bubble, Bush's TARP, and Obama's continued QE incompetence. 

People want jobs, certainty, good economic outlook, their degree they've spent so much on to mean value etc etc not fucking free birth control.

Ignoring male rape not only neglects men, it also harms women by reinforcing a viewpoint that equates 'female' with 'victim', thus hampering our ability to see women as strong and empowered.

Obama has been one of the most honest politicians, on Israel, in recent history. I'm grading on a curve here. He still would get an F if there was no curve. 

But Obama has had an evolution on this issue. As an Illinois politician, he was extremely critical of Israel. He even campaigned to American Muslims, claiming he would protect their rights, and the rights of Palestinians. 

Then came the big speech in 2004, when Obama went from being a newly elected Senator from Illinois (big whoop: his main opponent dropped out after sealed files relating to his divorce from 7 of 9... I mean Jeri Ryan... went public. Are you shocked? The guy who was married to Jeri Ryan was a bit of a perve. That left Alan Fucking Keyes to run against him. Youtube that name if you want to get a laugh).

After that speech, everyone was talking about the great promise that was Barack Obama, and suddenly he became more pro-Israel than Ariel Sharon.

But, at heart, the dude is still more pro-Palestinian than Bush, Clinton, other Bush, or Reagan. So if anyone was going to do the right thing on Iran, its Obama.

There's another issue with Iran, though, and it has nothing to do with Israel. Iran isn't a pushover. It has a big military. It held off Iraq for a little less than a decade while hundreds of thousands of people died in the crossfire. So going to war with Iran would mean lots of casualties, which would mean that Obama's popularity would go way down. As much money as AIPAC has, it wasn't able to insulate Bush from complaints about the death toll in Iraq, and Iran looked even worse, particularly after the Iraq and Afghanistan collective clusterfucks. 

So Obama had a lot to gain by staying out of Iran. And the Senate doesn't have anything to lose by backing war on Israel's behalf, since its less popular than even this shitty president, and it will be the president that gets hurt by an unpopular war, not the Senate."

I could go more in detail as to other factors which kept Gore from winning, such as Gore picking Democratic backstabber Libermann to be his running mate to distance himself from Clinton when Americans decisively sided with him against the Republicans after his impeachment. Or the fact the media constantly lambasted Gore as being to analytical and stiff while giving Bush a free pass on everything. (The 2000 election sinks the myth of the liberal bias in the media, which of course doesn't exists, because it's corporate run and they just side with whoever suits their purposes best.)

Dov Zakheim is an ordained rabbi and reportedly holds Israeli citizenship. Zakheim attended Jew's College in London and became an ordained Orthodox Jewish Rabbi in 1973. He was adjunct professor at New York's Jewish Yeshiva University. Zakheim is close to the Israeli lobby.

Dov Zakheim is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and in 2000 a co-author of the Project for the New American Century's position paper, Rebuilding America's Defenses, advocating the necessity for a Pearl-Harbor-like incident to mobilize the country into war with its enemies, mostly Middle Eastern Muslim nations.

He was appointed by Bush as Pentagon Comptroller from May 4, 2001 to March 10, 2004. At that time he was unable to explain the disappearance of $1 trillion dollars. Actually, nearly three years earlier, Donald Rumsfeld announced on September 10, 2001 that an audit discovered $2.3 trillion was also missing from the Pentagon books. That story, as mentioned, was buried under 9-11's rubble. The two sums disappeared on Zakheim's watch. We can only guess where that cash went.

Despite these suspicions, on May 6, 2004, Zakheim took a lucrative position at Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the most prestigious strategy consulting firms in the world. One of its clients then was Blessed Relief, a charity said to be a front for Osama bin Laden. Booz, Allen & Hamilton then also worked closely with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is the research arm of the Department of Defense.

Judicial Inc's bio of Dov tells us Zakheim is a dual Israeli/American citizen and has been tracking the halls of US government for 25 years, casting defense policy and influence on Presidents Reagan, Clinton, Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. Judicial Inc points out that most of Israel's armaments were gotten thanks to him.

He played an important role in the Iran-Contra Scandal, which involved illegally selling U.S. weapons to Iran to fight Iraq, and illegally funding the contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government. He also actively deceived three congressional committees about his involvement and thereby faced felony charges based on his testimony. Abrams pled guilty in 1991 to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. A year later, former President Bush (Senior) granted Abrams a full pardon. He was one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the Reagan Administration's State Department.

Okay, two points:

Responding here because it's the only frontpage thread that isn't blatantly racist or flooded by blatant racists or about lizard people.

Secondly, far left social liberal, or more accurately enlightened transcendent, but a few points about Obama.

Stock Market at all time high is not a good thing in this context. It's not horrible, either, it's neutral. It affects, ultimately, a tiny subset of humanity. If you had to break it down, the stock market values at this stage actually favor the wealth divide, and represent things that are bad for society.

The dollar isn't relatively strong. Not sure where you got that. It's stable thanks to central banking, but it's not doing great and more and more ignorant idiots hate central banking, so....

Housing bubble already blowing up again. The idea of using land for short term investment flipping has, sadly, only gained in popularity despite the last bust. 

Peace with Iran? That hasn't been established yet. Let's not count those chickens before they're hatched.

The Nobel Peace Prize Obama received was the ""thank you for not being Bush,"" prize. Just because Obama isn't as god awful as what the US right wing is ponying up these days is not a real endorsement. 

We have taken step one towards intelligent health care, and it was one of the weakest steps imaginable. We can, yes, applaud those among the DNP for accomplishing even this, but overall it was glacial. That step was taken with half a ton of iron chained around its ankles .

Obama has managed to get some things done. He's also happily fucked up his own legacy horribly (wtf drone strikes, no transparency,, drug war, etc.,) but Clinton overshadows him and I'd say that if we measure both intention and result, Carter also contends. 

Obama had a chance to make a legacy. I dunno if someone threatened him or if he's actually just a big, stupid asshole but he dropped the ball and he dropped it hard."

Elliott Abrams
National Security Council Advisor. He previously worked at Washington-based ""Think Tank"" Ethics and Public Policy Center. During the Reagan Adminstration, Abrams was the Assistant Secretary of State, handling, for the most part, Latin American affairs. He played an important role in the Iran-Contra Scandal, which involved illegally selling U.S. weapons to Iran to fight Iraq, and illegally funding the contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government. He also actively deceived three congressional committees about his involvement and thereby faced felony charges based on his testimony. Abrams pled guilty in 1991 to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. A year later, former President Bush (Senior) granted Abrams a full pardon. He was one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the Reagan Administration's State Department.

Marc Grossman
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. He was Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources at the Department of State. Grossman is one of many of the pro-Israel Jewish officials from the Clinton Administration that Bush has promoted to higher posts.

Richard Haass
Director of Policy Planning at the State Department and Ambassador at large. He is also Director of National Security Programs and Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). He was one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the first Bush (Sr) Administration who sat on the National Security Council, and who consistently advocated going to war against Iraq. Haass is also a member of the Defense Department's National Security Study Group, at the Pentagon."

Libby was also a lawyer for convicted felon and Israeli spy Marc Rich, whom Clinton pardoned, in his last days as president. Libby was recently found guilty of lying to Federal investigators in the Valerie Plame affair, in which Plame, a covert CIA agent, was exposed for political revenge by the Bush administration following her husband's revelations about the lies leading to the Iraq War.

Dov Zakheim
Dov Zakheim is an ordained rabbi and reportedly holds Israeli citizenship. Zakheim attended Jew's College in London and became an ordained Orthodox Jewish Rabbi in 1973. He was adjunct professor at New York's Jewish Yeshiva University. Zakheim is close to the Israeli lobby.

Dov Zakheim is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and in 2000 a co-author of the Project for the New American Century's position paper, Rebuilding America's Defenses, advocating the necessity for a Pearl-Harbor-like incident to mobilize the country into war with its enemies, mostly Middle Eastern Muslim nations.

He was appointed by Bush as Pentagon Comptroller from May 4, 2001 to March 10, 2004. At that time he was unable to explain the disappearance of $1 trillion dollars. Actually, nearly three years earlier, Donald Rumsfeld announced on September 10, 2001 that an audit discovered $2.3 trillion was also missing from the Pentagon books. That story, as mentioned, was buried under 9-11's rubble. The two sums disappeared on Zakheim's watch. We can only guess where that cash went.

Despite these suspicions, on May 6, 2004, Zakheim took a lucrative position at Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the most prestigious strategy consulting firms in the world. One of its clients then was Blessed Relief, a charity said to be a front for Osama bin Laden. Booz, Allen & Hamilton then also worked closely with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is the research arm of the Department of Defense.

Judicial Inc's bio of Dov tells us Zakheim is a dual Israeli/American citizen and has been tracking the halls of US government for 25 years, casting defense policy and influence on Presidents Reagan, Clinton, Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. Judicial Inc points out that most of Israel's armaments were gotten thanks to him.

If one bothers to make the comparison, it's pretty obvious.

Wealth disparity is increasing and many turn their backs to the promises of the economic system. The economy itself is on unstable ground, pretending everthing is fine, when it's really not.
The military spending is out of control, but its power, while huge, still isn't sufficient to control the sphere of influence anymore, because it has been spread thin and isn't able to achieve its objectives anymore - partially, because it's given nearly impossible objectives.
The allies are acting up and start making their own policies - except the US can't even just invade, like the USSR sometimes did, to keep them in line.
The leaders no longer gather the respect leaders used to get. Like Andropov, Chernenko and Gorbachev were no Khrushchev and no Stalin, so are Clinton, Bush jr. and Obama no Reagan or Eisenhower.

2016 CNN Poll: Clinton deadlocked with Christie but leads other GOP presidential possibilities

Washington (CNN) - In a potential preview of the next presidential election, a new national poll suggests Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie would be neck and neck if the 2016 contest were held today.

But a CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday also indicates Clinton leading eight other possible Republican White House hopefuls in hypothetical general election matchups.

They lost in 2008 because they tried to steal the one-issue woman vote by making Palin VP after Clinton withdrew. It backfired so hard, I sincerely hope everyone behind the decision was kicked out of the party. Palin made it her personal mission to destroy the reputation of the Republican Party, and she succeeded.

They lost in 2012 because incumbent politicians have a huge advantage AND Mitt Romney was outrageously out of touch with the common man.

A report released last week by Middle East human rights groups presents extensive evidence of war crimes carried out in Libya by the United States, NATO and their proxy “rebel” forces during last year’s war, which brought down the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The “Report of the Independent Civil Society Fact-Finding Mission to Libya” presents findings of an investigation carried out last November by the Arab Organization for Human Rights, together with the Palestinian Center for Human Rights and the International Legal Assistance Consortium.

Based on interviews with victims of war crimes as well as with witnesses and Libyan officials in Tripoli, Zawiya, Sibrata, Khoms, Zliten, Misrata, Tawergha and Sirte, the report calls for the investigation of evidence that NATO targeted civilian sites, causing many deaths and injuries. Civilian facilities targeted by NATO bombs and missiles included schools, government buildings, at least one food warehouse, and private homes.

the only reason clinton ever ""made the US prosperous"", as you say, is because just a few years before his election, the iron curtain had fallen and therefore the US military spending had been cut back due to a lack of threats.

with one less gigantic tumor sucking the life out of the economy, the US naturally prospered - for a few years.

soon after, *they* made sure that would never happen again - you know - having an artificial enemy that you can actually defeat - and *they* therefore invented a new enemy in order to bring orwell's endless war :

one that cannot die, ever.
one that will guarantee endless profits for military firms and even more so the wall street banks that finance them.
one that will guarantee endless catastrophes to be exploited, both for financial and political reasons :

the terrorist.

he can be anyone, anywhere, anytime. he can never die out, he can never be defeated.

clinton didn't do anything particularly well, because he was a puppet like anyone else.

he just happened to be in office just between two artificially created enemies (the rusky and the terrorist), when peace was the only option and the jews couldn't inflate the military industrial complex for a few years."

Shitty. But not as shitty as Bush and Obama having our own people slaughtered by the thousands on reasons based on lies. At least TWA was likely an accident and not a blatant war for no reason. I guess the gov't had no choice but to cover up TWA, if they admitted to it then there would be 100 times the outrage. With so much video recording technology and internet nowadays, it's probably much harder to cover that stuff up, because at least 20-25% of the witnesses would have recorded it with their cell phone thinking it was a UFO or something. 

I hope the next fuckface who gets ""elected"" (election layout is another bullshit thing that will not change in our lifetimes) into office doesn't do this retarded shit that Obama and Bush does."

Bill Clinton started the war on terror you stupid goy.

>No torture of prisoners

Clinton got his political power, wealth, and influence from running drugs through Arkansas for the cia. He didn't bother torturing people, he flat out murdered them.

The main reason you look back at clinton with happy faces is because Clinton was the first president to take control over the media to new and exciting levels, like using military spy satiletes to hijack news room feeds so he could spy on the networks and know exactly what kind of questions they would ask him at press conferences."

Clinton can be easily defeated you forget the democrats were in a similar state in 2008. The funny thing is Clinton will be the McCain of 2016 most likely. She will be demolished by a ""down and out"" republican party.

We just need the right candidate (Rand)."
